### TODO
* ~~percentage of texts sent first/last or good morning/good night~~
* **how immediate responses were sent**
* ~~number of texts sent over time~~
* ~~scatter plot of messages each hour of the day~~ (ignore)
* correlations; what would the variables be though? # texts, sentiment(including emojis), spacing out of responses, excitement? or #texts sent at once before other responds
* **sentiment** over time
